# GOV.UK Frontend example

**Ruby specialised line** for **GDS-compliant** government frontends: **Ruby / Rails / ViewComponent** generate HTML; **[GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/)** (latest pinned version) is the **only** UI component library. **No frontend frameworks** (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.) for UI.

All component HTML should track **GOV.UK Frontend macros** / `template.njk` via **native Ruby** renderers in `lib/govuk` (do not shell out to Node just to render). Never long-term copy-paste release HTML. Official **test fixtures** from each Frontend release are the contract: the **Ruby HTML** must match every fixture `html` byte-for-byte. A Nunjucks-only check is not enough.

**LIVE guidance** — [Design System feedback](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/feedback/).

**Language rule:** This line is **Ruby / Rails**. Every feature and code change must follow **current Ruby and Rails** best practices (project layout, gems, tests, packaging, CI, lint) — without weakening the non-negotiables below. Prefer current stable idioms over outdated tutorials. Conventions: [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md).

**HTML generation:** Generate component and page HTML **natively in Ruby** (`lib/govuk` + ViewComponent + ERB layouts). Do **not** require Node at request time for rendering. Always track Frontend’s macros/`template.njk` as the behaviour reference and prove Ruby ≡ fixtures. Never long-term copy-paste static HTML from each release.

**GOV.UK Frontend’s own stack:** Frontend ships as a **Node** package with **Nunjucks** macros, official `fixtures.json`, and `template.njk` sources. Use Node for install, fixtures, Sass, and optional Nunjucks freshness checks. Refer to Nunjucks for macro options and escape behaviour even when the wrapper reimplements them.

**Guidance rule:** Prefer searching the URLs in [`docs/guidance-sources.md`](docs/guidance-sources.md) over inventing local policy.

**Documentation rule:** Every prompt, feature, and code change for this template **and** projects built from it must leave **comprehensive dual-audience documentation** (humans + AI agents) in the right place. Detail: [`docs/documentation-structure.md`](docs/documentation-structure.md).

## Non-negotiables

1. **GOV.UK Frontend macros are the HTML source of truth** — render via Nunjucks macros on Node-adjacent stacks, or via a native wrapper renderer that tracks those macros. Do **not** copy-paste component HTML from release notes or the Design System site as the long-term approach, and do **not** shell out to Node just to render HTML from a non-Node backend.
2. **Backend HTML must match every official fixture** — for each shipped component, the **Ruby** rendered HTML is compared byte-for-byte to the `html` in that release’s `fixtures.json`, for **every** fixture. That is the primary parity gate. A Nunjucks-only check (macro output vs stored `html`) proves fixtures are fresh; it does **not** replace Ruby vs fixture comparison. No normalisation; never edit fixture `html` to pass tests. See [`docs/testing-components.md`](docs/testing-components.md).
3. **No frontend UI frameworks** — no React/Vue/Angular/Svelte (or similar) for GOV.UK UI; backend + GOV.UK Frontend only.
4. **No ad-hoc custom CSS** — ship styles through the Sass pipeline in [`styles/`](styles/) (`application.scss` → GOV.UK Frontend `@use` → [`govuk-overrides.scss`](styles/govuk-overrides.scss) last). Prefer component options and Design System patterns; do not paste or serve Frontend’s prebuilt `govuk-frontend.min.css` as the long-term source. See [`docs/styles.md`](docs/styles.md).
5. **No `!important` in service CSS** — overrides must win with cascade order and specificity only. This applies to every project using this template. Frontend’s own `govuk-!-…` utilities are upstream; do not copy that pattern into service styles.
6. **Components via macros / library API** — never hand-paste component `govuk-*` markup into pages.
7. **Patterns compose components** — Design System patterns are pages/journeys, not new low-level components, and have no fixture-parity suites.
8. **WCAG 2.2 AA baseline** — skip link, one `h1`, visible focus (never override yellow focus), keyboard paths, Error summary + field errors, `novalidate`.
9. **Progressive enhancement** — core tasks work without Frontend JS; keep `js-enabled` / `govuk-frontend-supported` and `initAll()`.
10. **Do not ship unreleased GOV.UK chrome** — wait for Frontend release + fixtures. See [`docs/govuk-frontend-roadmap.md`](docs/govuk-frontend-roadmap.md).
11. **100% code coverage** — functions, branches, and statements at **100%** for application/library code under test; CI must fail below that. Do not weaken fixture HTML equality to chase coverage. See [`docs/testing-components.md`](docs/testing-components.md).
12. **Dependency and Frontend upgrades need a green pipeline** — follow [`.cursor/skills/safe-dependency-updates/SKILL.md`](.cursor/skills/safe-dependency-updates/SKILL.md). For `govuk-frontend`, also read https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/latest and [`docs/upgrading-govuk-frontend.md`](docs/upgrading-govuk-frontend.md).
13. **Performance and security baseline** — every response uses [`baseline/`](baseline/) (cache kind, OWASP headers, CSP hash for the `js-enabled` snippet). Language lines sync that directory; they do not invent a weaker set. See [`docs/frontend-performance.md`](docs/frontend-performance.md) and [`docs/frontend-security.md`](docs/frontend-security.md).
14. **Split finished work into focused commits** — once a coherent piece of code or docs is complete, create **specific** commits with **comprehensive** messages (why, contract impact, how to verify). Do not leave a large mixed working tree; do not squash unrelated concerns into one commit. This applies to agents and humans using this template.
15. **Document every change for humans and agents** — no feature, prompt-driven change, or behaviour lands without dual-audience docs updated in the right place (`/docs` detail, `AGENTS.md` / skill / rules links when contracts change, onboarding or CONTRIBUTING when workflow changes). Aim for easier onboarding and maintenance. See [`docs/documentation-structure.md`](docs/documentation-structure.md).
16. **Follow the latest Ruby / Rails best practices** — see [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md). Shared Node tooling (Sass, baseline, fixtures) follows current Node/ESM practice. Never weaken Frontend, parity, security, or performance non-negotiables to chase a fad.

Using this repo does **not** make a service assessment-ready. See [`docs/service-assessment-readiness.md`](docs/service-assessment-readiness.md).

## Quick page review

Before finishing a page change:

- [ ] Page template shell / before-content / single `h1` / title
- [ ] Macros / library API only for GOV.UK UI blocks (not pasted HTML)
- [ ] Back link **or** breadcrumbs — not both
- [ ] Forms: `novalidate`, Error summary + messages, values retained
- [ ] Focus styles untouched; no `outline: none`
- [ ] Trusted/sanitised HTML only; prefer plain text options
- [ ] HTML responses use the baseline security headers; assets use the matching cache kind
- [ ] CSS from the Sass pipeline in `<head>` (not prebuilt `govuk-frontend.min.css`); Frontend JS is an external `type="module"`; the `js-enabled` snippet matches the pinned CSP hash
- [ ] No `!important` in service styles; overrides only via `govuk-overrides.scss` specificity
- [ ] Pattern guidance followed; out-of-scope widgets called out with inset text
- [ ] Coverage remains 100% functions / branches / statements for touched library code
- [ ] Backend parity suite green: library/backend HTML ≡ every fixture `html` (not only Nunjucks ≡ fixtures)
- [ ] Fixture parity still green for any touched components
- [ ] Dual-audience docs updated (humans in `/docs` or CONTRIBUTING; agents via `AGENTS.md` / skill / playbook links if contracts changed)
- [ ] Code follows the recorded language’s latest best practices ([`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md))

## Watching upstream

Dependency bumps (npm, language packages, Dependabot) and Frontend pin changes: [`.cursor/skills/safe-dependency-updates/SKILL.md`](.cursor/skills/safe-dependency-updates/SKILL.md) (**CI must be green** before start and before complete). `govuk-frontend` still uses [`docs/upgrading-govuk-frontend.md`](docs/upgrading-govuk-frontend.md).
